Sure! Let’s break down React Router concepts from the basics and list out the topics you should understand. We’ll go step by step:

### **1. Basic Routing**
   - **Setting Up React Router**: How to install and set up `react-router-dom` in a React application.
   - **`BrowserRouter`**: What it is and why we use it.
   - **Defining Routes with `Route` and `Routes`**: How to declare routes and link them to specific components.

### **2. Navigation**
   - **`Link` vs `NavLink`**: How to navigate between different routes using `Link` and `NavLink`.
   - **Programmatic Navigation (`useNavigate`)**: How to navigate to routes programmatically (e.g., after form submission or an API response).

### **3. Nested Routes**
   - **Nested Routes Concept**: Understanding child routes and how to render components inside a layout using `Outlet`.
   - **`Outlet` Component**: How to use it to render child components within a parent route.

### **4. Route Parameters**
   - **Dynamic Routes and URL Parameters (`:id`)**: How to pass dynamic segments in the URL (like `/user/1`).
   - **`useParams` Hook**: How to extract parameters from the URL inside a component.
   - **Optional Parameters**: Using optional parameters in your routes.

### **5. Redirection**
   - **Redirecting with `Navigate`**: How to redirect from one route to another.
   - **Default Redirection**: How to handle default redirects when no specific route is provided.

### **6. Route Protection**
   - **Protected Routes (Private Routes)**: How to restrict access to specific routes (e.g., for authentication).
   - **Custom Route Wrappers**: Creating components to wrap around routes for logic like authentication checks.

### **7. 404 and Fallback Routes**
   - **Handling 404s (Page Not Found)**: Setting up a route for invalid or unknown URLs.
   - **Wildcard Routes (`*`)**: Using a wildcard to catch all undefined routes.

### **8. Lazy Loading Routes**
   - **Code Splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`**: How to load routes only when needed to improve performance.

### **9. Query Parameters**
   - **Handling Query Parameters**: How to work with query parameters in URLs (e.g., `?search=term`).
   - **`useSearchParams` Hook**: How to manage query parameters in React Router.

### **10. Scroll Restoration**
   - **Scroll Restoration Behavior**: Understanding how to control the scroll position when navigating between routes.
