Getting into Google as a Software Engineer requires a well-structured approach. I'll break it down into a personalized strategy based on your background and current skills.

---

### üîç **Analysis of Your Current State**
#### ‚úÖ Strengths:
- **3 years of experience** in software engineering.
- **Full-stack experience** (MERN, Frontend & Backend roles).
- **Worked in Automation & UI feature development**.
- **Interest in C++ & Python** (though not very experienced in both yet).
- **Started learning Graphs & Data Science**.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gaps & Areas of Improvement:
1. **Problem-Solving & DSA**:  
   - You need **strong problem-solving skills** (Leetcode Medium-Hard level).
   - Limited exposure to **graphs** (a major topic in FAANG interviews).
   - Unknown current **speed & efficiency** in solving problems.

2. **System Design**:  
   - Not much mention of system design knowledge.
   - Google expects **high-level design skills** (esp. for SDE-2+ roles).

3. **CS Fundamentals**:  
   - Need a **refresher on OS, DBMS, Networks** for theoretical rounds.

4. **Language Proficiency**:  
   - You're **more comfortable in JavaScript**.
   - Google prefers **C++ / Java / Python** for problem-solving.

## üéØ **Roadmap to Crack Google SDE**
### üìå **Phase 1: Evaluate & Build a Strong DSA Base (1-2 months)**
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Assess Your Problem-Solving Level**
- Take a **Google-style mock test** (1-hour Leetcode assessment).  
  - 1 Easy, 1 Medium, 1 Hard (Array, Graphs, DP).
  - Track your accuracy & speed.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Master Data Structures & Algorithms**
- **Target: 300+ problems (Leetcode / Codeforces / Codechef)**
- **Priority Topics** (Most Asked in Google):
  - Arrays & Strings (Sliding Window, Two Pointers)
  - Recursion & Backtracking (Subset, Permutations)
  - Trees & Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)
  - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LIS, LCS)
  - Heap & HashMaps
  - Bit Manipulation
  - Tries & Advanced Graphs (Strongly Connected Components)

- **Recommended Resources**:
  - Neetcode 150 / Striver SDE Sheet / Blind 75
  - Aditya Verma‚Äôs DP Playlist
  - Codeforces Div2 Contests (for speed)

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Competitive Programming (Optional, but Helps)**
- **Participate in**:
  - Codeforces (Div2 contests)
  - Leetcode Weekly Contest
  - Google Kickstart Past Papers

### üìå **Phase 2: System Design & CS Fundamentals (1 month)**
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Low-Level Design (LLD)**
- **OOP, Design Patterns, SOLID Principles**
- Practice designing:
  - Parking Lot
  - Tic-Tac-Toe
  - URL Shortener
  - Rate Limiter
  - Multi-threading basics (important!)

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **High-Level Design (HLD)**
- **Scalability, Databases, Caching, Load Balancing**
- Read:  
  - **Grokking the System Design Interview**
  - YouTube: Gaurav Sen, ByteByteGo
  - Design Instagram, YouTube, Google Drive

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **CS Fundamentals**
- **Operating Systems**: Process, Threads, Deadlocks
- **Networking**: HTTP, TCP, Load Balancers
- **Databases**: Indexing, Sharding, Replication

---

### üìå **Phase 3: Mock Interviews & Resume Polish (1-2 months)**
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **FAANG-Style Mock Interviews**
- **Weekly mock interviews** (Leetcode + Pramp + Interviewing.io).
- **Google interview simulator** (via interviewing.io).

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Behavioral Interviews (Google‚Äôs GCA Round)**
- **Googleyness & Leadership Principles**:
  - STAR Method: Situation, Task, Action, Result.
  - Past experience-based questions.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Resume Enhancement**
- FAANG-Style Resume:
  - Impact-driven bullet points.
  - Quantify achievements (performance, optimizations).
  - Add **projects with scale (Millions+ users)**.

- **Apply via Referrals & Direct Applications**.

### ‚è≥ **Timeline: 4-5 Months**
| Month | Focus Area |
|--------|----------------|
| 1 | DSA Foundation + Problem Solving Assessment |
| 2 | DSA Advanced (Graphs, DP, Trees) |
| 3 | System Design (LLD + HLD) |
| 4 | Mock Interviews + Behavioral Prep |
| 5 | Resume + Applications + Final Revisions |

---

### üöÄ **Action Plan for This Week**
1. **Take a Leetcode Assessment** (Track performance).
2. **Solve 3 DSA Problems Daily** (Easy ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Hard).
3. **Start a System Design Course**.
4. **Schedule 1 Mock Interview**.
