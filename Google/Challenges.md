Great question! Many people face this issue when practicing DSA. Here's a structured approach to help you **learn, retain, and apply** problem-solving techniques effectively.

## **üìå What to Do If You Can‚Äôt Solve a Problem?**
1. **Spend at least 30-45 minutes on the problem** before looking at the solution.
   - Try different approaches (Brute force ‚Üí Optimized).  
   - Break the problem into smaller subproblems.  
   - Dry-run your logic with sample inputs.  

2. **If stuck, look for hints first instead of the full solution.**  
   - Leetcode has a "Discuss" section where you can get small hints.  
   - Think why your approach failed and what needs to be optimized.  

3. **Understand the solution properly before moving on.**  
   - Don‚Äôt just read it‚Äî**reimplement it from scratch** without copy-pasting.  
   - Explain the logic out loud or write a short **summary in your own words**.

## **üìå How to Remember & Retain Solutions?**  
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Maintain a Notes System** (Notion, Google Docs, or Handwritten)  
For every problem, write:  
‚úÖ **Problem Name + Category** (e.g., "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters - Sliding Window")  
‚úÖ **Your First Approach** (Why it didn‚Äôt work)  
‚úÖ **Optimal Approach & Key Takeaways**  
‚úÖ **Pattern it follows** (e.g., "This is a Two Pointers problem with a Sorting trick")  
‚úÖ **Similar Problems List** (So you can revise variations)  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Active Recall: Solve It Again**  
- **Re-attempt the same problem after 2-3 days** without looking at the solution.  
- **If you forget, re-learn the approach and write it down again.**  
- **Use spaced repetition:** Solve the problem again after **1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month**.  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Group Similar Problems Together**  
- If you solve **3 Sliding Window problems**, note down what‚Äôs **common** among them.  
- Instead of memorizing solutions, **focus on recognizing patterns.**  

üìå Example:
- "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"  
- "Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K"  
- "Minimum Window Substring"  
‚û°Ô∏è **All use Sliding Window, so I should look for a variable-length subarray trick.**  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Teach Someone or Explain Out Loud**  
- Explain the problem & solution to yourself as if teaching a beginner.  
- This improves **understanding + retention**.  

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Do Variations of the Problem**  
- Once you solve a problem, **solve 2-3 similar ones**.  
- Example: If you solved **3Sum**, try **4Sum, Two Sum, and Subarray Sum Equals K**.  

---

## **üìå What If You Keep Forgetting?**
- **That‚Äôs normal!** The key is **deliberate practice + spaced repetition.**  
- Use a **problem tracker** (Notion, Google Sheet) to track when you should reattempt.  

üöÄ Want me to create a **Google Sheet template** for tracking problems & spaced repetition? Let me know! üéØ
